# AiArtGeneration

AiArtGeneration is a small project developed using Flask and the Hugging Face API. It enables users to generate images based on prompts, negative prompts, seeds, and other input parameters. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, this project allows you to explore the creative possibilities of AI-generated artwork.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Generate unique and captivating images using the Hugging Face API, which utilizes advanced deep learning models.
- **Prompt-based Generation**: Input prompts or descriptions to guide the AI model in generating images that align with your vision.
- **Negative Prompts**: Utilize negative prompts to guide the model in avoiding specific elements or styles in the generated images.
- **Seed Control**: Fine-tune the image generation process by providing a seed value to ensure consistent or reproducible results.
- **Explore Artistic Styles**: Experiment with different prompts, negative prompts, and seeds to explore various artistic styles and themes.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enjoy a simple and intuitive user interface, allowing you to interact with the AI model effortlessly.

## Showcase

Here are some examples of images generated using AiArtGeneration that used the same prompt and Anime model:
